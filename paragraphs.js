    `Greenhouse effect is a natural process wherein sunlight passes through
    atmosphere, warming earth’s surface. Then, the earth’s surface and water bodies
    release energy in form of heat or infrared radiations into atmosphere and
    maintains balance with the incoming energy. Greenhouse gases can absorb
    some of the infrared radiation. But increase in greenhouse gases has led to more
    absorption of infrared radiation which in turn has led to the increase of earth’s
    surface temperature.`,

    `Global warming is the latest alarm bell for earth’s environment. Global warming
    refers to the increase in average temperature of earth’s surface during the last
    century, from 1900-2000. Earth’s surface’s temperature has increased more than
    one degree Fahrenheit since 1900. Global warming is alarming because of its
    adverse effects on the ecological balance of earth. The resultant ecological
    imbalance, due to global warming, is the root cause of various natural calamities
    like floods, famines, etc. Also it is the root cause of various environmental threats
    like increase in sea level, glacier melting, changes in quantity and pattern of
    rainfall, heat waves, extreme seasons, etc. This is why global warming is the
    buzzword of almost all environmental talks, projects and discussions, etc.`,

    `There are so many great moments and speeches in this film. It really is a must see.
    But for me, having gone to University and met people like Clark, I couldn’t help but 
    fall in love with Will in this scene. This moment is just incredibly funny and
    Damon’s delivery is spot-on. Will Hunting (Matt Damon) proves that you don’t have to
    be book-smart to be intelligent, and that you shouldn’t look down on others just because
    they don’t have the same fancy level of education that you do. This is the put-downs to end all put-downs"`,


    `In the second instance, we hear the same speech again, but we are now in the bathroom of Brett’s apartment \
    with one of Brett’s quaking friends. Hearing the speech in this way, and seeing this other guy’s
     confused reaction to it, makes us re-evaluate what we have heard. Does it even make
      sense? We were too busy being mesmerized by Jackson’s performance to actually think 
      about what he was saying.`,

      `What is important to remember is that this is not an anti-capitalist film.
       It’s about two different types of capitalism: the ruthless kind advocated 
       by Gekko and the more traditional kind practiced by his victims. So, what
        Stone does here is very clever. At the shareholders’ meeting,
       Gekko (a representative for all brokers) is given the chance to justify
       his actions, and he does so by identifying the waste and slothfulness that
       corporal America has acquired in the postwar years. 
       He cleverly shifts the blame and is so eerily convincing that we’re 
       almost inclined to agree with him; his audience certainly does.
       To succeed in this way, this has to be a speech that is both well-written
       and well-performed. Scarily, this speech is said to have inspired many young professionals to work on Wall Street too.`,

      `It’s hard not to love Tom Hanks, but he really wins over his 
      audience (and Reiben) with this speech. He teaches kids, for
      goodness’ sake, and he’s leading a squad on a heroic mission.
      And all he wants to do is go home to his wife.
      Some might say that this pulls a little too much at the heart strings,
      but I think it is beautiful. It has that David vs. Goliath-type quality to it,
      where an ordinary man is about to rise up and do something truly heroic.
      We love you Tom!`
